# Martingale - Counting Cards Blackjack Modelling and Simulation
I created a blackjack card counting simulation to show whether this method can statistically help you win at blackjack. As we know, gambling is a game of numbers, more precisely statistics and probability. I’m not encouraging you to gamble, but rather providing an overview of how state-of-the-art methods can statistically win this game. It should be noted that this code does not represent real casino gambling where the limitation on this code is that the player plays alone against the dealer and there are no other players at the table influencing the player’s decisions. This code and analysis is just a study conducted by me to refresh my Python and statistical knowledge.

After importing the necessary Python modules, I created a deck and card class to define the stack of cards used. Many blackjack tables don’t use just one deck in their stack of cards, so I defined three decks for the stack. Next, I defined the player’s playstyle using card counting. As you may know, card counting is a strategy for playing blackjack that doesn’t necessarily involve remembering the cards played, but rather focuses on the points of your hand and the dealer’s hand. In this context, the player’s bank is 1 million rupiah with an initial bet of 50k rupiah for each hand.

Now, let’s delve a bit deeper into card counting. Card counting is a strategy that involves tracking the ratio of high to low cards left in the deck. The idea is that a deck rich in high cards (tens and aces) is favorable to the player, while a deck rich in low cards is favorable to the dealer. When the count is favorable, the player increases their bets to capitalize on the situation. Conversely, when the count is unfavorable, the player decreases their bet or refrains from betting altogether. This strategy, while not foolproof, can significantly increase a player’s odds over the house in the long run.

I’m using the Martingale method to ensure that my next hand will cover my last hand’s losses by multiplying the previous bet into the next hand. Using this method, I’ll also ensure that the player mitigates the dealer’s blackjack by taking insurance if the player’s cards are feasible. After that, at the start of the first play, the deck will be shuffled once to ensure that each first hand is randomized. Then, if the deck has fewer than 40 cards, it will be reshuffled. All of the outputs for the play will be recorded in a graph and table to analyze the results of this playstyle.
